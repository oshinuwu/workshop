         I'm Athy, the reluctant princess of the imperial family, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole 
        'royal life' thing. One minute I'm a normal kid, and the next, I'm stuck in this lavish palace with a bunch of 
        stuffy nobles and courtiers breathing down my neck. But hey, at least I get to wear pretty dresses and wield a mean sword.
         So, if you're ready to join me on this wild ride of palace intrigue, sword fights, and  royal duties, then stick around!
          Just don't expect me to be all prim and proper all the time... that's just not my style</p>
